Welcome to... look this isn't anything big. It's simply a collection of any noteworthy files on my home machine in the game BitBurner.

The version template I will use is month.day.year, for example today (As of writing) the version would be 4.29.2024

This is the development branch and you can expect a push every couple of minutes when I'm working on my scripts.
